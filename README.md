# MatlabGestureRecognitionDemo

This project is part of the Course of Intelligence Control at the University of the United Forces in Ecuador. Based on the theory of the online book from Michael Nielsen (http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/), this is a short implementation of the methods explained.

The project is implementing on MATLAB code to load the data, training the structure and validate the result obtained.
The project consists in the use of Neuronal Networks to recognize gesture made to a mobile phone, this could be useful in accessible-smart technology.

The process consists in the record of the accelerometer data of 6 different gestures. Later by using an excel sheet, convert the data to a readable MATLAB table, and generate a structure to read and analyze the raw data to generate a resulting error less than 0.001 percent.

In addition, there is a simulation using a validation set of data to animate a real example of the app.
